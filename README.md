## Overview

### Links

- Solution URL: [With Github Pages](https://saratuma.github.io/Card-Component/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

I learned to add an image in css with color and opacity, to work with mobile first and to explore flex box as well.


### Continued development

I'll be focused on the frontend area right now, and I hope it all works out. I intend to improve the positioning of elements on the screen, responsiveness, and other accessibility techniques, without forgetting interactivity.


### Useful resources

- [Flex Box](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Helped me a lot when positioning the elements on the screen.
